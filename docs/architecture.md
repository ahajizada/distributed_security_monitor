# System Architecture
## Overview
The Distributed Security Monitoring System is designed as a scalable, microservices-based architecture for processing and analyzing security logs in real-time. The system consists of several independent services that work together to provide comprehensive security monitoring capabilities.

## Core Components
1. Log Ingestion Service

- Receives security logs from various sources
- Validates and enriches log data
- Publishes logs to Kafka for processing
- Handles high throughput with horizontal scaling

2. Analysis Service

- Consumes logs from Kafka
- Performs real-time threat detection using ML
- Identifies anomalous patterns
- Generates alerts for suspicious activity

3. Alert Service

- Manages alert distribution
- Supports multiple notification channels
- Handles alert prioritization
- Provides alert aggregation

4. Frontend Dashboard

- Real-time visualization of security metrics
- Interactive data exploration
- Alert management interface
- Responsive design for various devices
